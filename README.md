# Coding Practice

This is my code base to store code samples to interesting problems I find while studying. Current problem types are:
- Dynamic Programming

But this list will expand overtime as I find more problems that are very interesting/challenging. Within each code sample contains comments that describe
  1. Problem Statement
  2. Intuition
  3. Crux (the key aspect of the problem required to solve the problem using the most efficient algorithm)
